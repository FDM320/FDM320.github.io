This is a simple program that simulates dice rolls. It can simulate dice with any number of sides, and can roll any number of times.  
The first prompt will ask the user to input the number of sides on the die that they'd like to roll.  
The second prompt will ask the user to input the number of times they'd like to roll their die.  
The program will keep running until the user types "quit" at the first prompt.
