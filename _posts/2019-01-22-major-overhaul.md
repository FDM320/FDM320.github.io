I updated the graphics on all of my pages to make them more visually appealing.
In the spirit of things, I thought this rocket launch with a cloud of colors would be a very appropriate background for this post.
I added a table of my skills to my About page, and I streamlined all of the layouts that I had been making.
I also added the Projects page, where I'll keep links to all of the GitHub Project Pages that I'm working on.
Finally, I set the backgrounds to fit to the screen size that they're displaying on as well, so the site would, in theory, be more mobile friendly.
Unfortunately, it didn't help. I'm still trying to figure out why my site looks so terrible on mobile.
The backgrounds aren't resizing like they're supposed to. I'll keep working on it and hopefully come to a resolution soon.
