Hey everyone, here comes another big update.
     
I've actually been working on this one since right after I published the last update. 
I noticed after publishing the last update that the site still looked terrible on mobile devices. 
It didn't scale like I expected it to. 
As a result of this, I started learning Bootstrap. 
Bootstrap is really cool, but I had a hard time getting my page looking the way I wanted it to. 
It took me a little over a week to get everything working.
I finally just got everything perfect a few minutes ago! 
Now the site should scale based on the size of the screen that's viewing it. 
I messed with the layout a bit, and I think the site looks much better now. 
Thanks to Bootstrap, my content should be centered regardless of your screen size.
I also added navigation bars that stick to the top and bottom of the screen as you're scrolling. 
Try resizing your window to be smaller. 
Did you see how the navigation bars went away and were replaced with toggle icons? 
I'm pretty proud of that!
Speaking of icons, I started using Font Awesome to add icons here and there, and I'm really happy with the results. 
I also expanded my skills table with a section called Industry Knowledge, and updated my resume accordingly. 
It should look much better now. 
Finally, I made it so that if you're clicking a link that scrolls you further down the page, it scrolls smoothly instead of teleporting you. 
Try it out with the table on the About page!
    
Thanks for checking out my website and following my updates, I really appreciate it!  
Talk to you next time!
