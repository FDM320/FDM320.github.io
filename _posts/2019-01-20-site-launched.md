I read a [tutorial](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) to put this website together, it's great! You should definitely check it out if you're interested in creating a website or showing prospective employers the projects that you're working on. It's powered by [Jekyll](https://jekllrb.com) and hosted by [GitHub](https://github.com). You can write posts in Markdown, which is very easy to learn.
