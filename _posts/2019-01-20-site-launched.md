I read a [tutorial](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/){:target="_blank"} to put this website together, it's great! You should definitely check it out if you're interested in creating a website or showing prospective employers the projects that you're working on. It's powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com){:target="_blank"} and hosted by [GitHub](https://github.com){:target="_blank"}. You can write posts in Markdown, which is very easy to learn.
