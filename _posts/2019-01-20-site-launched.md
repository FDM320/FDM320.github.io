I read a <a class="{{ page.link-type }}" target="_blank" href="http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/">tutorial</a> to put this website together, it's great! You should definitely check it out if you're interested in creating a website or showing prospective employers the projects that you're working on. It's powered by <a class="{{ page.link-type }}" target="_blank" href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> and hosted by <a class="{{ page.link-type }}" target="_blank" href="https://github.com">GitHub</a>. You can write posts in Markdown, which is very easy to learn.
